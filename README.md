# xrandr layout

![python shield](https://img.shields.io/github/pipenv/locked/python-version/shashankgroovy/xrandr-layout?color=%231DB954&style=flat-square)

A simple utility script that works with [xrandr](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xrandr) to change/switch between different layouts.

For now it works with my Arch installation with one external monitor setup with i3wm.

## Requirements
1. xrandr
2. python 3.x

## Run

```
λ python toggle.py
``` 

## Future updates

- Finish the feature to save current screen layout configuration to a config yaml file
- Make it an installable package, so that it's just a pip install away :)
